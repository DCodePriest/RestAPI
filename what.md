what are template literal ? 
Template literals are a new feature of JavaScript introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). They allow you to embed expressions inside a string by using backticks (`) instead of double or single quotes.

In a template literal, you can include expressions inside the string using the ${} syntax. These expressions are evaluated and their values are inserted into the string at the corresponding locations.

Here's an example of using template literals to create a string:

const name = 'John';
const message = `Hello ${name}! How are you?`;
console.log(message);


In this example, the name variable is used inside a template literal to create a string with the name "John" in it. The resulting string would be "Hello John! How are you?".

Template literals are a convenient way to create strings that contain dynamic content, as well as multi-line strings. They can also make your code more readable and easier to maintain.


what is expression ? 

By expressions, I mean any valid JavaScript expression that can be evaluated to a value, such as variables, function calls, arithmetic operations, and more.

In a template literal, expressions are enclosed in curly braces ${}. The expression inside the curly braces can be any valid JavaScript expression, and its value will be computed and inserted into the string when the template literal is evaluated.

For example, in the following template literal, the expression 2 + 2 is evaluated and its value (4) is inserted into the string:

const result = `The sum of 2 and 2 is ${2 + 2}`;
console.log(result); // The sum of 2 and 2 is 4


In the context of the original code you provided, the expression ${createduser.firstName} inside the template literal is evaluated to the value of the firstName property of the createduser object, and that value is inserted into the string when the template literal is evaluated.
